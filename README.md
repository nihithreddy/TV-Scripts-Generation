# TV-Scripts-Generation

This is a third project in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using LSTM RNN. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Getting the project files
You can download the project files from the udacity github repo  in the project-tv-script-generation folder or you can also download the files by using git clone command.

git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git 

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.
